# Curses

Negative feelings toward another are a commonplace thing.  
Whether justified or not, invariably, one person does something to upset another, and such feelings come about.  
These emotions, concentrated and maintained enough to result in health problems for the one feeling them, can result in a curse.  
  
Simple fleeting anger, flashes of guilt, these are not enough to bring about the effects of a curse.  
Only one steeped in such an emotion, burning with an unquenchable rage, stewing in a mire of envy...  
Alternatively, it can be brought about in a far stronger capacity by a population sustaining such a mindset.  
Hatred toward an unjust ruler, disgust toward a nearby village...  
All such things can lead to curses.  
  
The range of what a curse can cause is quite wide indeed!  
Preventing necessary rain, visitations of a plague, and frequent attacks from wild beasts are the more subtle sort.  
The more overt can take quite insidious forms.  
An invisible wall preventing one from leaving their home.  
Spontaneous combustion while walking down the road.  
The slow and systematic loss of every loved one a person has ever known.  
  
Curses are used in cautionary tales for two very important reasons.  
To urge the creatures of Chaydis to be kind to their neighbors...  
And to caution those of strong passion, lest they allow themselves to be consumed in the creation of one.  
  
In their own way, curses are much like a living creature, striving to propagate themselves via the spreading of misery and frustration.
