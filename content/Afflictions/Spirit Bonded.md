# Spirit Bonded

A [[Humans|human]] in a particularly desperate circumstance may reach out to a [[Spirits|spirit]] for aid.  
A [[Spirits|spirit]] may strike a deal with a [[Humans|human]], in order to join together and experience the world more completely.  
Whatever the cause of the joining, it can not (to the knowledge of current researchers) be accomplished unless both parties are willing.Â A [[Spirits|spirit]] bonded [[Humans|human]] will cease aging at the point of contract, and gains immense power.  
The tradeoffs are that their capacity for memory is not increased, and their personality is tinged by the [[Spirits|spirit]] that they form this pact with.  
For some, a small price to pay for immortality.
The [[Spirits|spirits]] do not answer all who call.
The [[Spirits|spirit]] that bonds with the [[Humans|human]] does not, by any means, cease to exist.  
They continue to live on, a consciousness shared.  
And the power that they grant can manifest in a number of ways.  
The three main that have been witnessed are as a manifestation of their former selves, as a weapon representative of themselves, or as an ability that they once possessed.  
True, full manifestation is the strongest of these, but it involves giving over control of the body completely to the [[Spirits|spirit]] during that time, and not all are conscious of it when it happens.
