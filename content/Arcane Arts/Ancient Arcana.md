# Ancient Arcana
### Humanity's First Mana Manipulation

## General

The original use discovered for [[Mana|mana]] crystals.
Sheer destructive force, unable to be reduced or contained, merely aimed, slightly shaped, and released.
Through destabilizing the crystalline structure by introducing a small amount of [[Mana|mana]], the crystal begins to deteriorate at a rapid rate.
At this point, the wielder would either need to run far away from the crystal, or throw it as hard as they can, or (in the early days, for best results) both.
A rare person indeed would be capable of, and willing to, repeat the process a second, or even third time.
Any crazy enough to accomplish that would, through exposure, begin to 'feel out' the expended force, and use some of the oomph to shape the blast away from themselves.

## History

This was decidedly the first of the arcane ways developed in Chaydis, developed accidentally through an instinct to preserve one's own life.
The unimaginable force of it, while impressive, made it quite unsuitable for defending oneself from a single target while within a settlement.
Not without horrific casualties.

For the most part, this method was seen as a springboard for many others.
While they lack the raw power of their ancestor, they made up for it in control and utility.
