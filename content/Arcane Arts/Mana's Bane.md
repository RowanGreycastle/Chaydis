# Mana's Bane
### The People's Voice

## Overview

Simply put, this is a powder made of a [[Mana|mana]] crystal that has been ground up, allowing for easier airborne spread.
Upon coming into contact with one who possesses their own [[Mana|mana]], but is not actively controlling it, the powder detonates.
Not 'quite' immediately, but soon enough after to allow for very little time to react.

## History

This simple invention has been used to shape the path of nations.

After the development of the [[Ancient Arcana]], many advancements were made in the usage of [[Mana|mana]].
The age of [[Humans|humans]] was one of great strides, allowing for incredible things to be done!
Not all things were positive.

The invention of Mana's Bane came about during a time of great unrest within the [[Humans|human]] cities of old, where those with control over [[Mana|mana]] reigned supreme.
In a single violent evening, a single gathering, the government of nearly a whole country was upended and replaced.
