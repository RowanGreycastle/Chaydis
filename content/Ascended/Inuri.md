# Inuri
### Ascended of Famott and Narys

## Overview

*"Driven, dogmatic antfolk from the [[Black Desert]] under [[The Sun|the sun]].*
*Very [[Narys|community]] focused they are, all about following [[Famott|the rules]].*
*The ones that come out this way have all sorts of crazy ideas about what's what.*
*If you see one roamin' by themselves, either they've been kicked out, or everyone they knew is dead, an' I'm not sure which one's worse for 'em.*
*Coming to grips with no [[Shard Consciousness|Queen]] to serve damn near drives 'em mad!*
*They might start tryin' to learn the laws of the land and the names of everyone in town, or they might try 'n form their own colony by recruitin' folks.*
*Either way, there'll be a bout where they lock themselves away, probably have a good think about things.*
*... Mind, I've only seen a handful of 'em in person.*
*Each one shared a trait though; they gave off an air of [[Fyre|passionate devotion]] toward anything they set their sights on."*

## General Appearance

Inuri bodies appear to be made of blackened glass.
Their shape is primarily ant-like, though they are (generally) bipedal.
Their 'skin' is translucent, with a dark mistiness inside, and an overall jagged appearance.
Their multi-faceted eyes sparkle with a redness rivaled only by a blazing fire.
The amount of limbs they have will generally depend on the task they've been assigned, with skilled workers tending toward four arms and two legs for increased workflow, while those lifting and carrying heavy things will generally wind up with two arms and four legs for increased carrying capacity. If no specialized work is required, two arms and two legs is enough.

## Dietary Considerations

They are omnivorous, though they consider meat to be a rare treat that must be enjoyed to its fullest.

## Communication Methods

Through body language alone, a method called [[Tentone]], they're capable of holding whole simple conversations without once opening their mouth.

## Human Comparison

Inuri mouths are VERY ant-like, which can certainly lead to staring when [[Humans|humans]] are talking to them.
