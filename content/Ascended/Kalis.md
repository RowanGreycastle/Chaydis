# Kalis
### Ascended of Verath and Metti

## Overview

*"Industrious rabbitfolk from [[Laef]].*
*Dangerous place, only [[Verath|death himself]] knows how they manage to survive there.*
*Maybe their [[Metti|wits]] alone are enough to help 'em?*
*Whatever the case, they're a fine folk, always willing to work things out and lend a hand where they can.*
*They can live dang near anywhere, since they're good at diggin' holes.*
*Got a way with [[Gro|plants]] that rivals the [[Spirits|spirits]].*
*All that said... they've got an [[Sight Unseen|extra sense]] about danger.*
*I've seen 'em uproot a whole community overnight, only for things to go belly up a few days later.*
*If they suddenly pack up?*
*Best to follow."*

## General Appearance

Kalis bodies appear to be made of flesh, blood, and fur, similar to any normal rabbit.
Clearly shaped like an upright rabbit, with some inspiration taken from [[Humans|humans]].
Their fur colour can range broadly, with a variety of patterns, though the most common colours are black, grey, and white.
If there is a pattern, it tends to use black for accents.

## Dietary Considerations

They are obligate herbivores, though that by no means makes their food bland.

## Communication Methods

Through the gesture-based language of [[Quicksigns]], pre-established ideas are communicated in an instant.

## Human Comparison

Kalis do not seem to need to blink, which can come off as quite unsettling.
