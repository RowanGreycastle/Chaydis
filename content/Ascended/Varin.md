# Varin
### Ascended of Shax and Metti

## Overview

*"[[Shax|Tricksy]] foxfolk from the [[Empty Lands]].*
*The cold and darkness hasn't helped their sense of humor none.*
*[[Metti|Crafty]] little things are as likely to tell you a dirty limerick as they are to make off with your chickens!*
*And good luck chasin' after 'em; they [[Shadow Meld|disappear]] quick as they came, poppin' behind some little bush only to not be there when ya catch up.*
*Doesn't seem to matter if they're surrounded, they'll find a way out.*
*Hate to think what it'd be like to meet a full grown one.*
*Only ever been the [[Wite|young]] seen... so far."*

## General Appearance

Varin bodies appear to be made of flesh, blood, and fur, similarly to any normal fox.
Clearly shaped like an upright fox, with some inspiration taken from [[Humans|humans]] early in life.
Their features are softer than one might expect from an adult, with cheeky smiles being one of the only signs of their precocious nature.
The appearance that they have now is the appearance that they'll have for the rest of their lives.
One of the only things that shifts is their fur colour; those that stay within the [[Empty Lands]] have white fur, while those that leave rarely keep the colouration.
They take pride in their fluffy tails.

## Dietary Considerations

They are omnivores, capable of eating a wide variety of plants and meat.
This diet puts them most in line with the tastes of [[Humans|humans]] that need meat in their meal to be satisfied.

## Human Comparison

Varin do not biologically age, putting them quite at odds with the standard [[Humans|human]] experience.
