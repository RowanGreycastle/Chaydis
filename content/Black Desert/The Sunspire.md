# The Sunspire
### The Seat of the Sun

## Overview

At the center of Chaydis, standing impossibly tall above the sands of the [[Black Desert]], the Sunspire can be found.
Easily towering over everything else, this strange structure is home to [[The Sun]], and is responsible for sending it up into the sky each morning, and catching it again during nightfall.

## Interesting Facts

While within the known lands, a compass will always point toward the Sunspire.  
East is counter-clockwise around the spire, while West is clockwise, leaving South to point out toward the frozen wastes.

## Secrets

The Sunspire is a vast spear that was used by [[Famott]] to pin [[Possibility]] to Reality.
The haft of the spear is all that pokes above the surface, and was repurposed to be the home of [[The Sun]].
