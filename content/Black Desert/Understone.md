### Trade Port of the Black Desert

Located at the [[Unclaimed Continent]] edge of the [[Black Desert]], a particularly large black glass spike juts from the sands.
This shields one of the only settlements above ground in all of the desert.
[[Humans]] and [[Inuri|inuri]] alike have cobbled together a life here, using sun obscured shore access as the only trade route into the desert that doesn't run through [[Dungeons|dungeon]] passages.
The sunlight shining through the jagged glass is dimmed considerably, allowing for the cooling winds from the [[Inring Sea]] to keep things livable.

The original inhabitants lived behind an outcropping of the removed mountain long before the glass erupted, but the name of the settlement stuck.
