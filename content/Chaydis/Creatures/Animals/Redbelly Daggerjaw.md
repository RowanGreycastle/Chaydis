# Redbelly Daggerjaw

## Overview

Named for the large, hooked, dagger-like teeth they possess, and the fact that during mating season, their bellies turn red.  
Mating season is the best time (for [[Varin|varin]]) to try to catch them, as they become very aggressive, and more likely to fall for a trap.  
They have a carnivorous diet, feeding on smaller fish, crabs, wayward fishermen, and anything else that happens to be in or around the water during springtime.  
In the less active months, daggerjaws conserve their energy, allowing themselves to freeze solid in most cases to increase chances of surviving the winter.  
  
The meat of the redbelly is a delicacy among the [[Varin|varin]]; high in fat and protein, a steak seasoned with sea salt, complimented with a side of fried rymecaps makes for an exceptional meal.
