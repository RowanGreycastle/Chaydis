# Acita
### Ascended of Gese and Narys

## Overview

*"Strange little mothfolk from [[The Moon|the moon]].*
*They're said to be the children of [[Gese|the wind]] and the messengers of [[Narys|unity]], accordin' to the temple.*
*There might even be some truth to it, considerin' how they take on tasks.*
*If it doesn't grab their attention, if it doesn't 'catch' 'em, they pay it no mind.*
*If they've gotta focus on it, they struggle somethin' fierce.*
*If something DOES grab hold, it can easily become an obsession.*
*One they may be able to conjure up answers for after a simple good night's sleep, without once having asked anyone; like the answer just came to 'em on the breeze.*
*They insist that they travel to a '[[Elway|dream realm]]' when they [[Sleepless Rest|sleep]], and have nonsensical explanations for why people dream the way that they do.*
*Wherever they go, a [[Aer|'feeling']] follows after, and changes follow soon after that."*

## General Appearance

Acita bodies appear to be made of fluff of one sort or another, very unlike a normal moth would be.
An amalgamation of a domestic silk moth, a [[Humans|human]], and a cloud.
They appear to be soft, possessing a child-like roundness to the face, with large eyes that commonly possessing mismatched colours.
Their mouth is far closer to that of a human than a moth.
Upon their backs, large, fragile wings are folded.
Each set of wings is unique, possessing a pattern all its own.
The fluff colour and wing pattern will change upon the shifting of the seasons, taking on a more snowy white during the Winter, then fading back to their original colouration during the Summer.

## Dietary Considerations

Their foods need to be pre-processed into a fluid in order to be absorbed properly.
Honey, fruit juices, and other natural syrups that contain a significant amount of sugar are favourites of the mothfolk.
They are obligate herbivores, and their dietary limitations have resulted in their eating utensil of choice being metal straws.

## Human Comparison

Acita have shorter lifespans compared to [[Humans|humans]], just over half of the expected average.
They are, on average, 3/4 the size of a [[Humans|human]], and half the weight.
Their bodies are nowhere near as strong or resilient, though they are fully capable of flight.
