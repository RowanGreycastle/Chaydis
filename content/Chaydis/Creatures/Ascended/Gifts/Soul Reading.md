### Gift of Seith to the Lagos

## Overview

[[Arken]] so impressed [[Seith]] with her honesty, that he sought to pass this trait on to their shared creation.

The geckofolk are capable of seeing through falsehoods of all sorts with a glance.
A feint, a ruse, a simple white lie, an illusion... It matters not.
Sight unobstructed by mirrored surfaces will lead them to the truth of the matter in short order.
This is the reason why [[Lagos|lagos]] culture has evolved to possess a disdain toward lying, as from their point of view, there's no purpose to it.
