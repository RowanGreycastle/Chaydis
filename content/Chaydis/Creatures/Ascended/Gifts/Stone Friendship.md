# Stone Friendship
### Gift of Crom to the Gurem

## Overview

Through their relationship with rock and stone, the massive pangolinfolk can call upon that very same stone for protection.
With their voice alone, they are capable of wreathing themselves in protective hardness.
With a practiced stomp, they can rearrange the ground beneath them as they see fit.
There are very few things the [[Gurem|gurem]] can not keep safe with rock underfoot.
