# Gurem
### Ascended of Crom and Arken

## Overview

*"Gentle giants, the pangolinfolk from the craggy mountains of [[Sten]].*
*Always jokin' about, claimin' they '[[Stone Friendship|grow mountains]]' in their spare time.*
*And really, who can blame 'em?*
*I know one who's old enough to've been old when my father was a boy.*
*They're a [[Rok|tough sort]]; very little poses an actual threat to 'em because of that thick skin.*
*With that much goin' for ya, who wouldn't have a good sense of humor?*
*They've got a strong sense of what's right and wrong with the mountains, and if they can, they'll [[Crom|work to fix it]], which helps us plenty.*
*It can be a bit difficult to keep in contact with 'em though, since they're the [[Arken|solitary sort]], though if you can manage to befriend one, some day your grandkids might meet 'em.*
*And they'll remember you, as if they met ya yesterday."*

## General Appearance

Gurem bodies appear to be made of flesh, blood, fur, and keratin, similar to any normal pangolin.
They're shaped like an upright pangolin that's had the bulk of a bear added to it.
Their armored plates cover the top and back of their head, the back of their neck and shoulders, the back of their arms and torso, and the back of their legs and tail.
It's nearly impossible to pose a threat to them when attacking from their back or sides, but their front is also defended by their big, clawed digging hands.
When they sleep, they curl into a ball, covering themselves completely in their armored plates.

## Dietary Considerations

Their ascendance has granted them more dietary options than their regular counterparts.
They are omnivorous in the extreme, allowing them to draw sustenance from plants, meat, and even certain types of stone.

## Human Comparison

The average height of a gurem is roughly half again as tall as a [[Humans|human]], and twice as wide.
Their weight ranges from four to eight times that of an average [[Humans|human]].
They age exceptionally slowly, easily enough to surpass several generations of [[Humans|humans]].
