# Lagos
### Ascended of Seith and Arken

## Overview

*"Scrappy little geckofolk from the poisonous waters of [[Weva]].*
*Don't let their stature fool you; they move fast and hit like a runaway cart!*
*And that tail of theirs is a weapon all its own!*
*[[Akwa|Zip]] around the seas and lakes like the water's theirs, because it is.*
*That said, they're not the sort to come at ya swingin' if y'don't have a [[Arken|warrior's spirit]].*
*And they'll know right off if ya don't.*
*They can [[Soul Reading|see a lie a mile off]], so puffin' your chest out and blusterin' ain't gunna impress 'em.*
*Prefer folks to be blunt with 'em.*
*And if y'should ever befriend one, if they offer you food, don't even try it!*
*What doesn't kill you might make you [[Seith|wish you'd died]]..."*

## General Appearance

Lagos bodies appear to be made of flesh, blood, and scales, like any normal gecko would.
Their scales are overall bright and vibrant, their stature is generally quite small, and their tails are excessively large compared to the rest of their body.
Some possess horns atop their head.
A naturally defined musculature shows through.

## Dietary Considerations

They are obligate carnivores, lacking the ability to process most plant matter.
They'll still use certain plants to preserve and/or season their foods, though most that have the flavor or property they're seeking out within the continent of [[Weva]] are considered quite poisonous to others.

## Human Comparison

Lagos are naturally as strong as a human that has trained their body, while having a stature roughly half the size of an adult human.
