# Humans
### From Nothing They Came

These strange creatures originate from nowhere.
Their creators are unknown.
There are no known abilities [[Gifts|gifted]] to them.
They rarely naturally create any [[Mana|mana]] at all, and if they do, it could be anything.

## Appearance:

Human bodies appear to be made of flesh, blood, and fur, though they do not share an appearance with anything else native to Chaydis.
They lack any sort of fur or scales, other than on completely nonsensical parts of their body, and their colours are quite limited.

## History:

Humans have existed in Chaydis for nearly as long as it has existed.
Having sprung up out of the [[Highest Mountain|mountain]] surrounding [[The Sunspire]], they spread across the lands.
