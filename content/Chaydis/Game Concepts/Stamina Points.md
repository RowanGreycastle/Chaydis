# Stamina Points
### Game Concept

Rough draft first attempt at making a satisfying hitpoint system.
First, it allows for a more cartoony sort of fighting system, in that folks can get beaten up, but only really die of the stakes get RAMPED.
Second, it ties the other systems to the hitpoint system, because it's really more of an exhaustion system.

I'm going to toss around some numbers for examples, but this could easily be adjusted.
At the beginning of each day, each character gets ~3 freebie 'hits' that won't cause any negative side effects, possibly boosted with armor.
Each character has ~5 'hits' until they're exhausted and can't do anything else.
An attack landing in combat takes one 'hit'.
Doing activities in town takes one 'hit'.
Travelling long distances takes one 'hit'.
The only way to regain them is with rest.
