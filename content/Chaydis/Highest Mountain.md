# Highest Mountain

Within the fables ofÂ Mountain, Jungle, Plain, and Sea, Highest Mountain is characterized as a masculine figure who is stubborn and uncompromising to those that question its motives, while being caring and protective of those that choose to live in its lands and prove that they are hard workers.
The high spirit has a tendency to look at the long term picture, and completely miss the 'small' details that could cause problems for those under its care.
