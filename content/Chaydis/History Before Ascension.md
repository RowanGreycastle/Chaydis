# History Before Ascension

This will act as a rough timeline of events starting after the creation of Chaydis, and leading to the creation of the [[Ascended]].
All that lies before that, only the gods themselves truly know.

## Spirits

Upon completion of Chaydis, a fair amount of the energy that was used in the creation, [[Mana|mana]], was still present and without purpose.
This surplus energy looked upon the world, upon the plants and animals already present, and took inspiration.
The first of the [[Spirits|spirits]] were animalistic in nature, unaware of what they did not possess.

## Humans

Upon the settling of the [[Spirits|spirits]], [[Humans|humans]] emerged from the [[Highest Mountain|mountain]] surrounding [[The Sunspire|the spire]].
They made their way down the sides, settling the lands near the base, and only daring to travel into the surrounding jungle while numbers were large.
Such treks were dangerous, and the number who made it through to the plains on the other side were few.

## The Sun

The light of the sky was all drawn to one point, syphoned from everywhere to gather together into a ball.
[[The Sun]], now set atop the newly named [[The Sunspire|Sunspire]], gazed down upon a confused populace.

## Monsters

And with [[The Sun|the sun]] came the first sunset.
And the first night.
And on the first night, the creatures that had been held at bay by the light, hidden away in the jungle's depths, discovered they were no longer bound to the canopy cover.
Many [[Humans|humans]] died on this first night.

## The Stars

The [[Taul|stars]] flickered into existence, one by one, doing what they can to illuminate the night.
Some see it as a flicker of hope.
Others, an omen of the end times.
Nothing immediate happens to signify what is true.
