# Dungeons

## Lore

"*Delvers came through town not two days ago. Sorted out the situation right quick they did! And a good thing too, the beasties that were callin' that place home were a SIGHT, let me tell you. Each of 'em had a mouth big enough to swallow a baby whole, and a mind t'do it too! ... Well anyways, off they went, and the next day, the whole thing just up and vanished! Poof! Y'see that forest over there? Wasn't there yesterday.*"
-Â old man Keelie, on the disappearance of the marble tower near Piketon

## Overview

Strange structures can and do pop up over night in the world of Chaydis. The architecture will frequently have some sort of unifying aesthetic with itself, but beyond that, anything and everything could be found within!  
That's not to say that there's no rhyme or reason to them, mind; far from it!  
A variety of rules regarding these naturally forming dungeons have been determined through exploration of a fair amount of them.

## Rules

Rule 1: Each dungeon has a creature at the very bottom organizing the whole thing.  
Rule 2: Each dungeon has a reward at the end that it's tied to.  
Rule 3: No matter how much it looks like you're outside while in a dungeon, you are NOT outside.  
Rule 4: Dungeons are not particularly stable, and will shift on occasion; the less stable the dungeon, the more possible shifts there are.  
Rule 5: Death in a dungeon is not necessarily permanent... unless the body is lost.
