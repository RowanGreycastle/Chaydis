# Mesaf
### The Realm of Reflection

A grand creation of [[Seith]].

## General

The land of origin for all creatures who seek to hunt through extreme and unnerving mimicry.
The landscape here is made up of rough approximations of Chaydis, though the view always has something a little off.
A dense fog prevents those who travel here from seeing too far into the distance.

## Secrets

The [[Mirrorfolk|mirrorfolk]] are one of the most common ways to end up in this place.
A result of gazing too long into a placid pool while within grabbing distance.
