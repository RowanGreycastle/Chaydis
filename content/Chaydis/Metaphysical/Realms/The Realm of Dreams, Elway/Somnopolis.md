# Somnopolis
### The Sleepless City

Located in [[Elway]].
Created by the [[Acita|acita]].

## General

Within the walls of Somnopolis, the shared dreamscape is mostly stable.
The architecture between buildings varies wildly, and the decor within buildings shifts whenever it isn't observed.
The 'mood' of such designs is the only thing that does not shift from its original.
Mind, everyone has a slightly different source of joy, anger, hope, fear, wonder...
And the observer is the one who dictates the result.

## Function

[[Acita]] will spend their entire afterlives here, and all of the time during their resting hours.
If this city was a small place, they would quickly go mad.
Because of this, it is a sprawling sea of strange sights and sounds, with much to do, and plenty of folks to talk to.
