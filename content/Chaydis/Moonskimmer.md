# Moonskimmer

A sailing vessel specifically designed to use the lunar winds to sail around the Inner Ring Sea.
In spite of its name and power source, these vessels are used exclusively during the day.
Used primarily for trade, these ships travel from continent to continent, always in a clockwise pattern around [[The Sunspire|the Sunspire]].
The ships are generally only large enough for around five crew members, a large sail, and a cargo hold.
Going out on the open sea at night is ill advised, and so no rest quarters exist aboard the vessel.
