# Black Desert
### The Sun Scorched Lands

The [[The Sun|sun]] scorched desert surrounding [[The Sunspire]], granted to the [[Inuri|inuri]].

The concentration of [[Mana|mana]] found here is nearly entirely [[Fyre]].

## Overview

Once the location of the tallest mountain of Chaydis, only sand and broken rocks now remain.
The sand has been burnt black by the intense heat beating down from above, and explosions of glass erupting from the surface are not uncommon.
Many small settlements can be found, here, though few are above ground level.

At night, the desert sands seem to come alive, sparkling gloriously as a near mirror of the night sky.
The twinkling of the broken glass catching the light of [[The Moon]] and stars above is said to be breathtaking.
This is the time that it is safest to travel the sands.
