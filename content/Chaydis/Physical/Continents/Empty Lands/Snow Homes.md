# Snow Homes

## Overview

The oldest successful home design of the [[Empty Lands]].
Before the materials for [[Stove Homes]] arrived on the shores, when wood was more scarce, these were the homes used to keep [[Varin|varin]] dry and warm.  
Compressed snow is carved out of the ground in into thick bricks, which are then set around the hole that was made to create a sturdy barrier that can keep the wind out.  
A staircase is cut down into the snow, and a fire pit is made at the lowest point.  
An raised alcove is dug out near the fire, with a ceiling that's deeper in the back to catch and maintain the heat coming off of the fire.  
These homes don't last; part of why the [[Varin|varin]] were nomadic for much of their existence
