# Sten
### Mountainous Lands

The craggy, mountainous continent that [[Crom]] chose for his [[Gurem|gurem]].

The concentration of [[Mana|mana]] found here is nearly entirely [[Rok]].

## Overview

The valleys between the mountains here are dangerous, as mist gathers there, which prevents [[Famott]]'s [[The Sun|light]] from cleansing fearsome monsters from the land.
The mountains themselves possess  more greenery the further North you go along the continent, while those to the South have ice caps, and are tallest.

Those who are not [[Gurem|gurem]] and live in Sten stay within one of the walled settlements, or they perish come nightfall.
