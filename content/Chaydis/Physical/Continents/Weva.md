### Bogged and Flooded Island Chains

The swampy island cluster 'continent' that [[Seith]] claimed for his [[Lagos|lagos]].

The concentration of [[Mana|mana]] found here is nearly entirely [[Akwa]].

## Overview

Rain is frequent and torrential in the area, resulting in plenty of flooding and mixing of fresh and salt water.
The landscape is mainly broken up by trees and hills, with the occasional hut or walled settlement.
The mist that covers the land is dangerous, devouring anything that gets caught within.

At night, the creatures hunt.
