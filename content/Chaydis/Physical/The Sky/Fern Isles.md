# Fern Isles
### Fern Shaped Sky Island Chain

When [[The Moon|the moon]] was removed from the ground and set aloft in the sky, the process used was not the gentlest.
Chunks of the now airborne stone and dirt separated off, drifting across the unseen surface upon which they'd been placed.
The Fern Isles are a grouping of the islands scattered across the sky, mainly inhabited by beasts capable of flying up so high, the descendants of those unfortunate enough to have been caught up in the upheaval, and the occasional curious [[Acita|acita]].
The pattern of the layout is how they got their namesake; it just so happens that the ferns there have continued to survive to this day.
Mothfolk aplenty have explored the islands, built treehouses, even just taken the time to relax here and admire the view.
Far below, so many worries and disputes made the air thick and unpleasant.
Up here?
The breeze is lovely enough to carry leaves and thoughts alike away into the open sky.
