# A Cold and Lonely Night

"Many a solo trav'ler did put trust in their own might;  
Took no heed in the warnings of their mother's desperate plight.  
Set off to see the farlands, witness strange and wonderous sight.  
There wasn't too much danger yet, the sky was still alight.

Now upon the winding roads, the sun begins to sink.  
"There's not a thing to worry 'bout." 's what they surely think.  
The grey sky blocks the starry night, the trav'ler stops to drink.  
They know not that they're quarry of the thing that makes one's bravery shrink.

The rain begins to fall, and so the trav'ler sets up camp.  
The long walk and the quickened pace have caused their feet to cramp.  
The fire flickers in the wind, as does the light of lamp.  
Familiar voice, their mother's call, does 'pon their resolve tamp.

They know the calling voice can't be, couldn't possibly be right!  
Their mother waits at home, safe, not lost in darkened fright!  
Some here might opt for caution, others, brave'ry of a knight.  
All of them are caught within A Cold and Lonely Night.

I'd love to set your heart at ease, assure you they'd prevail.  
To tell you of their gallant deeds; the monster they'd assail.  
But that is not the story; it is not that kind of tale.  
The best that I can offer is to be light on detail.

Maybe they would run and hide, to it's sure delight.  
Perhaps they would stand their ground, in hopes to win a fight.  
Lone trav'lers are a rare sort, even when it's bright.  
But not a one will 'er escape A Cold and Lonely Night."
