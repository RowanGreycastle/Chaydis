# Ograts of the Second World

Beyond the sunlit lands of Chaydis, where Famott's blazing eye cannot see, open caverns stretch on for unfathomable distances and depths.
Within this open space, the only light to be found is from the occasional strange crystal, odd mushroom, or the countless red eyes of the residents that beam menacingly in the dark.
Born within a world without light, ograts do not know or abide by the rules of those who live in the light.
During the night, they crawl up from holes in the ground, looking for things to bring back with them.
And if you should leave their door ajar at night, they may just decide to take you along as well.
They are not evil, and do not do this maliciously, yet the result is just the same; you'll wake to find you're beyond the sunlit lands, and with no way back.
Best to make sure your front door's shut tight before you catch some shuteye.
