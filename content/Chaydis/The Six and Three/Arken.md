# Arken
### Goddess of Independence

## Appearance

Arken appears within works depicting the gods as an ancient spear, plunged tip first into a scenic glade, with a red ribbon streaming from the handle.
A glorious symbol for a god whose chosen shape history, whether good, or ill.
Outside of that, she takes a form that shifts between onlookers, appearing to them as a member of the species they admire most, whose surface appears to be made of a shining, liquid metal.

## Overview

When the Age of Everything began, when Chaydis was solidified into what it would be for many years to come, Arken came to be.
Upon forming, she knew her purpose immediately.
With boundless boldness, she set off to make herself known; to meet with the leaders of Chaydis, and to make them aware of the existence of her and her sisters.
She is the sum and the source of ambition, the fountain of bravery from which creatures draw.
To know her is to know oneself, fully and completely, without ego or reservation.
Will you hide away within the comfort of obscurity?
Or will you take the reigns, and lead your followers toward a future of your own choosing?

## Grand Creations

[[Kyr]] is a creation of hers inspired by a room of animal trophies.
It is through the records of this place that history is immortalized, with statues of those who did the deed, important documents that they signed, and what they are most well known for.

Upon realizing that the world was vast, and she could not be everywhere at once to see the great things that people would accomplish, she created her [[Aids to the Destined]].
More a personality than a full being, they were functional enough to seek out those high in aspirations and drive.
This has led to the occasional mix up, though the potential of such a thing keeps her from becoming bored with success.
Hardship is part of growth, after all.

Her contribution to the creation of the [[Gurem|gurem]] was to convince [[Crom]] that such beings would be helpful to him.
It was not until she had explained fully that he even considered it.
To her, he was an enigma; an alluring oddity of honor and duty that sought no glory.

[[Seith]] was far easier to work with, in regards to the [[Lagos|lagos]].
She was honest with him, declaring her intentions, and what she hoped to achieve.
And he appeared to reciprocate, explaining in clear terms what he desired.
To her, he was one who shaped the world from obscurity, known but not.
A being that she understood completely.
