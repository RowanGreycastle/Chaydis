# Gese
### God of Freedom

## Appearance

Gese appears within works depicting the gods as his favourite rock.
Outside of such works, he takes the form of a humanoid mouse, wearing whatever fashion most catches his fancy in that moment.

## Overview

Chaydis would not be without [[Possibility]].
And [[Possibility]] would not be found without Gese.
If he had been given more time with it, no doubt something entirely different from Chaydis would have occurred.
Gese is one unbound from normalcy, delighted by a game with nonsensical rules, enthralled by an interesting, if meandering, story.
And even if he should encounter something normal, firmer rules, a more concise tale... so long as it's interesting, he's more than willing to play along!
His actions tend to be quite spur of the moment, and have resulted in some dangerous moments for Chaydis, but it's not for lack of caring!
On the contrary, he frequently cares FAR too much.
He is just an excitable god, looking for ways to make things a bit more free.

## Grand Creations

Gese is the one who 'created' [[The Moon|the moon]], as a favor to an [[Highest Mountain|interesting friend]].
Certainly, he nearly knocked [[The Sunspire|the Sunspire]] over in the process, but that was easily fixed!

[[Narys]] was exceptionally helpful with the designing portion of the [[Acita|acita]], whom he modelled after [[Famott]].
Moths are quite cool, you know!
If it were not for her assistance, they might never have been completed... or they might've been completed too quickly altogether.

As a test run, a place to play around and experiment with some of his wilder ideas, he created [[Elway]].
Within this place, he could plan out exactly how he wished for the [[Acita|acita]] to look, though others seemed to have troubles parsing what they were seeing within the ever-shifting realm.

His friends, the [[Wishing Stones]], are the rocks that he wished to give a purpose to after discovering his favourite rock.
The task bestowed upon them is being carried out to this day, so it is best to be careful what one wishes for out loud.

## Religious Practices

Those who devote themselves to Gese tend to travel a fair amount.
It's not uncommon to see a travelling temple to Him built into a cart or carriage.
Common rites performed involve guiding others in games, setting up a lottery for tasks, and leading those who come to visit in song.
The tasks are collected from around the settlement beforehand, as a way to anonymously request services, and small rewards are offered for their completion.
The songs are generally quite silly.
