# Metti
### Goddess of Foresight

## Appearance

Metti appears within works depicting the gods as an unlabeled book, with cover of black and trimming of silver.
An understated symbol for a god whose works are seen daily, yet not understood.
Outside of such works, she takes a form that shifts between onlookers, appearing to them as a member of their own species with a reserved demeanor.
It can be quite difficult to look directly at her without one's eyes just sliding right past.

## Overview

When the Age of Everything began, when Chaydis stabilized into what it was before Ascendance, Metti came to be.
Discovery of her purpose came slowly, though the process gave her certainty.
The more she learned, the further she could 'see' into the possible future events.
She is the sum of all gathered knowledge, made manifest.
To know her is to know one's own limitations, and wish to better oneself.
Will you be satisfied with what you have learned?
Or will you take what experience you can for the times that it will matter most?

## Grand Creations

[[Taul]] is a creation all her own.
It is through these rules written in the sky that she opened the door for entirely new scientific studies.

Her first living creations, her messengers, the [[Vision Maidens]], were initially created by taking the creature of spider wholesale, and granting it a consciousness and a connection to herself.
As she learned from her time with the chosen two, the design of her messengers advanced.
A more humanoid form, a more familiar form, until they could function more freely within society.
As she discovered, this was a mistake; knowledge is rarely gained without mistakes.

Her hand in the creation of the [[Kalis|kalis]] was one of curiosity, voicing questions that [[Verath]] had not thought to ask himself.
While her direct interaction in the process was limited, her mark is upon the final design.

The approach with the [[Varin|varin]] was far different, as she had gained an understanding already of how such creatures must go together.
[[Shax]] was suspicious of her assistance, but she demonstrated through her work that there was no duplicitous intent.

## Religious Practices

Those who devote themselves to Metti tend to be drawn in one of two directions.
Either they will become a teacher, in the hopes of guiding the education of the next generation and fostering inquisitiveness.
Or they will become a teller of fortunes through interpreting the webs of spiders.

That's not to say that there isn't some overlap.
A teacher that can get some small hints about her students can be quite helpful.
A fortune teller that can offer guidance is much more useful than one who simply offers an inevitable future.
