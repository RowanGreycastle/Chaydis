# Shadow Lanterns
## Lore

"*I remember, long ago... Back when I was juuuust tall enough to see past the windowsill... On a night like any other, I saw something that, at first, looked utterly unremarkable. A lantern, bobbing in the night. What about it caught my attention, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the idle curiosity of youth? Whatever the case, on tiptoes, I continued to stare out the window. Watched as it drew closer... No one was there. No being holding the lantern aloft. It seemed to just be floating there, 'leaning' in toward nooks and crannies like it was being held by someone searching for something. I yelped when it came close (not my finest moment), and this seemed to startle whatever it was, as the next moment, the lantern was on the ground below the window, and all signs of life had vanished. I'm sorry for startling that seeker in the night, and I hope it found what it was looking for.*"
