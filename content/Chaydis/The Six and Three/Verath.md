# Verath
### God of Cycles

## Appearance

Verath appears within works depicting the gods as himself, as he truly is, though generally only in one of his three forms depending on the work.
A humanoid squirrel to represent life, a large owl to represent death, or a deceased tree with many glowing eyes hidden in the cracks to represent the afterlife.

## Overview

At the end of the Age of Nothing, when Chaydis was first being formed, Verath was present to help in the creation of all life.
When Chaydis meets its end, Verath will be present to ensure it is done properly.
For he is life and death, the god of cycles.
His existence is a strange one, possessing three forms.
He is a delighted young squirrel, enjoying life and the many surprises it brings.
He is a merciless old owl, wise and terrible, and all too willing to take what is his.
He is a vast old tree, [[Pang|long dead]], housing the knowledge of ages past stored in a [[Library of All Ends|library]] built within him.
To know him is to know the joys of life, and to cherish them.
To know him is to know that all things come to an end.
To know him is to know that one day you too will die.
Will that end catch you by surprise?
Or will you greet him with a smile, satisfied that you have lived a good life?

## Grand Creations

Verath, in one way or another, has overseen the creation of all natural life on Chaydis... with one glaring [[Humans|exception]].
Every tree, every blade of grass, every insect; all of them are his creations.

He would certainly count the [[Kalis|kalis]] as one of his grandest creations, though he could not have done it without [[Metti]]'s boundless curiosity.

His servants, the [[Fungal Scribes]] who gather the bulk of information regarding the dead for him, are highly valued.
He could not hope to keep it all straight without their tireless efforts.

His realm, [[Pang]], is a place that a piece of him will always reside in.
He watches over the souls of the dead, the records of their deeds in life, and the messages sent by the living to those who were lost.

Through his influence, the natural creatures of the world have been allowed to adapt to the [[Mana|mana]] that surrounds them, instead of being forced to simply die due to incompatibility.
This is a mercy as well as a strategic choice, allowing for more diversity in the hopes that life will continue to flourish.

## Religious Practices

Those who devote themselves to Verath will find their duties ever-shifting.
As one who follows the teachings of the god of cycles, they will be sought out for all manner of things relating to life and death.
Possessing knowledge of such things is paramount, and so it is common for the followers of [[Metti]] to work hand in hand with Verath's own.

Whether by assisting in the delivery of a new child or a new calf, advising on a disease or broken bone, or addressing the grieving family in regards to their lost loved one, that is the profession they have chosen.
It's quite the difficult task; but if they don't do it, who will?
