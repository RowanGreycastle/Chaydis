# Empty Lands
### Infinite Frozen Wasteland

This is the land created by [[Shax]], and ruled as such.
It was granted to the [[Kalis|kalis]] upon their creation.

The concentration of [[Mana|mana]] found here is entirely [[Wite]].

## Overview

The inhabitable lands furthest from the center of Chaydis.
In all directions it spreads out, a white blanket of ice and snow.
Only vague outlines of what lays beyond can be seen; massive shadows shifting, mostly invisible through the flurry.

The shorefront is the largest in all of Chaydis, and a gathering ground of lost and broken sea vessels.
Dotting the shore, small lights can be spotted with a strong enough looking glass viewed at night.
Only the [[Kalis|kalis]] truly know how many villages are out there, as very few folks otherwise have ever been, or ever want to go.

Further inland, it's said that one may stumble across what appears as an oasis of drinkable water.
The shore at them is supposedly quite steep, and it should be obvious that no water would be liquid at this temperature.

## Secrets

This land was not created with the rest of Chaydis, and has existed for far longer.
