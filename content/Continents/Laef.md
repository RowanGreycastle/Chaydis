### Deeply Forested Lands

A verdant bowl-shaped continent that [[Verath]] chose for his [[Kalis|kalis]].

The concentration of [[Mana|mana]] found here is nearly entirely [[Gro]].

## Overview

There is much of this land that [[Famott]]'s [[The Sun|light]] has not touched since the growth of the forests.
The tree canopy blocks all vision of what hides far below, leaving those plentiful settlements along the shores to speculate and inform the curious travelers that happen there.

For those who brave the woods, night or day matters not.
There are tales of creatures there, sightless, who hunt with other methods.

## Secrets

The deep woods contains only sparse [[Kalis|kalis]] settlements, plentiful creatures that hunt them, and many reasons to stay far, FAR from the deep woods.
