# Unclaimed Continent
### So Say the Six and Three

While all other landmasses had been claimed in the name of a god and the god's people, this one remained free.
Free for the [[Humans|humans]] to use as they see fit.

The [[Mana|mana]] found here is diverse, and dependent on many different factors.

## Overview

As it has not been touched, the landscape is much more diverse than the others, possessing fields and mountains, forests and marshes, deserts and tundras.
Night here is dangerous, but no more than any other place.
Day here is safe, but no more than any other place.

## Secrets

The	continent is relatively untouched from the time of the splitting of the [[Continents|continents]], and so more natural processes have been allowed to take place, and the [[Spirits|spirits]] have had more say in how things develop.
