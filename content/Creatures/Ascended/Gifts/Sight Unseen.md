### Gift of Verath to the Kalis

## Overview

The first of the [[Kalis|kalis]] was far more in tune with his feral ancestors, and so the gift he requested was to sense danger in advance.
And so, it was granted.

By closing their eyes and forcing their senses outward, the rabbitfolk are capable of conjuring forth a phantom representation of the area, and having discussions with them.
The phantom can not overtly lie, but they can certainly twist words.
This is one of the many reasons that [[Kalis|kalis]] value games and practices that require one to identify exactly that sort of deception.
