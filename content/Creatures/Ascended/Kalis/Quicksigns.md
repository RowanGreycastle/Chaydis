### Language of the Kalis

## Overview

In the darkness of the deep woods of [[Laef]], it is dangerous above all else to speak.
The creatures here have troubles seeing, but their other senses are heightened to make up for it.
Heat from a torch would be enough to attract their attention, and so other sources of light are used, and hand signals placed in front of the illumination source (designed to convey important concepts quickly) are the chosen method to communicate.

Using it around other [[Kalis|kalis]] not part of the conversation while not being trained in its use, or in the deep woods is seen as uncouth, as you are indirectly calling those around you unsafe to be around, and/or oblivious.

The more urban [[Kalis|kalis]] of the rim will occasionally pick up a few meanings here or there, but have no true reason to learn it.
