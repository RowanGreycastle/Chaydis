# Limelings

Vibrant green amorphous blobs that hop and slide around the wild lands.  
Their name comes from their colouration.  
These creatures function as scavengers for both plants and animals, gobbling up the deceased that are left to rot with none to bury them.  
  
The creature or plant that they have digested most recently has an impact on the limeling, resulting in the limeling adopting the habits and routine of the consumed.  
This does not mean that the limeling takes on any of the creature or plant's traits, but instead leads to something much more unnerving.  
A limeling that consumes a mushroom may take on the shape of that mushroom, living in the area where the previous mushroom existed.  
A limeling that consumes a fisherman who unfortunately met his end by the river may come waltzing back into town carrying a tackle box and fishing pole.  
Or a stick and a rock, if they look enough like the two mentioned items.  
Or they may not come back into town at all, and instead pantomime fishing for as long as it remains in their system.
