# Shadow Meld
### Gift of Shax to the Varin

## Overview

Through their creation and their creator, the foxfolk are tied naturally to the dark.  
It is through this connection that they can slip easily from this world into another; [[Tenub]].  
All that's required is to stand in the shadow of something or someone else, and they're capable of disappearing right on into it with nary a sound.  
Once in this alternate land, their only sense of what's on the other side comes from the movements of shadows on the ground.  
A [[Varin|varin]] is safest where the light and shadow meet.
