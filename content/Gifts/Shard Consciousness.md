# Shard Consciousness
### Gift of Famott to the Inuri

## Overview

Through an intense dedication to single minded authority, the Queens of the antfolk developed a method to cut a piece from themselves that possesses a shard of their personality; the larger the piece, the more like them the result is.
Over time, a Queen can regrow the lost mass if not placed under stress.
The shard can be worked, shaped, and formed with the glass of the [[Black Desert]] to create a body for a new [[Inuri|inuri]].
If the shard is large enough, they will, in turn, be able to do this to create their own subordinates.
In this fashion, a Queen achieves the ability to oversee all of her land and tasks by herself.

## Secrets

Queens are not the only [[Inuri|inuri]] to have this ability.
When the rest of an [[Inuri|inuri]]'s colony dies, the survivor gradually gains a more fully fleshed out personality, tinged by what they were given.
At that point, no matter what their previous standing was, they are now effectively a Queen.
