# Sleepless Rest
### Gift of Gese to the Acita

## Overview

Through their origin, the mothfolk have an unbreakable tie to [[Elway|the realm of dreams]] which allows them to visit during resting hours, consciousness intact.
While within [[Elway]], they share a dreamscape with those of their kind, known as [[Somnopolis]].
All events within the city are remembered by the waking mind upon returning to Chaydis.
