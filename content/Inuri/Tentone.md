### Language of the Inuri

## Overview

Varying only slightly from colony to colony, the [[Inuri|inuri]] use this as their universal language.  
The mechanics of the communication involve the positioning of their antennae, and their posture as they speak.
The words themselves could be utterly meaningless, and still a great deal of information can be relayed just through this.
The antennae function in a fashion similar to pitch and tone, while gestures from the arms and hands indicate emotional state.
It is through this shared language of their species that they are able to get across simple concepts while not needing to speak, allowing them to have two conversations at once.
