# Mana
### The Unseen Power Source

## Natural Mana

Mana is a renewable resource within an environment.
It is by no means infinite, and if it is used up completely, this can lead to ecosystem collapse.

Mana was created in vast quantities when Chaydis was created.
Rare [[Humans|humans]] were born with the ability to produce mana, though they were incapable of releasing it from themselves without special training.
It was not until the creation of the [[Ascended]] that a consistent source was discovered to put mana back into the system; this brought about a new problem, as strong enough concentrations of mana result in natural disasters.

[[Dungeons]] are a naturally occurring source of mana, though they were very rarely helpful, as they could appear seemingly anywhere, and issue forth any sort of mana.

## Effects of Mana

Mana of a specific sort that becomes abundant will adjust the environment around itself.
A pocket of [[Gro]] in the [[Black Desert]] will cause plant life to spring from the charred and broken glass sands, only to wither and die from the intense heat.

## Mana Crystals

If the mana of a location remains dominantly one type for long enough, and is abundant enough, the excess will crystallize.
In this state, it is 'mostly' inert.

## List

Below is a list of currently identified types of mana.
They have been named as they are for their close association with, but clear distinction from, the natural world.
At current time, this includes:
[[Aer]]
[[Akwa]]
[[Fyre]]
[[Gro]]
[[Rok]]
[[Wite]]
