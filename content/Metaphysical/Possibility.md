# Possibility

## Overview

The origin of all things that Chaydis is, was, and will become.

## Secrets

Originally discovered by [[Gese]], this amorphous floating 'something' could have become anything and everything.
It was [[Famott]] who opted to take charge of creation and bring order to the chaos.
In doing so, He set himself solidly against such things, and set many events in motion He couldn't hope to predict.

Far beneath the surface of Chaydis, it still wriggles and squirms, attempting to free itself from beneath [[Famott]]'s [[The Sunspire|great spear]].
Appendages worm their way up through the rock and stone, only to be buried anew by [[Crom]]'s [[World Shapers]].

It is the belief of the [[The Six and Three|gods]] that [[Humans|humans]] are the creation of possibility, as they seemed to come from nothing.
Similar worries are held in regards to [[Spirits|spirits]], though their association with the land appears more beneficial.
