# Pang
### The Realm of Death

A grand creation of [[Verath]].

## General

It is a place located squarely between reality and oblivion.
When it touches down in an area, one can't help but feel the pang of melancholy.
Despite the various life cycles of the different species of Chaydis, all can (in one way or another) feel the regrets of the dead; if not for their own species, then certainly for others.
Should such a field link itself to a location in [[Laef]], [[Kalis|kalis]] travel from far and wide to have the opportunity to converse with an ancestor before they cycle anew.

## Speculation

A common belief is that Pang is a waiting area for the deceased to pass the time in while they wait to be sorted into the afterlife proper.
