# Mirrorfolk
### Imperfect Duplicates

## Legend

*"The ones who live within the reflections of lakes and ponds.
Best to not lean too close to a water with a still surface while alone, lest you find yourself dragged beneath the surface and into the mirror realm, replaced by your duplicate.  
There are few ways to tell if someone has been replaced by a duplicate, though a surefire method is to check their reflection in such a surface, and see if it acts strangely.  
If the duplicate is slain, the original can not be retrieved.  
Only by throwing the duplicate into the water can the original be retrieved."

## Overview

[[Seith]] crafted these creatures as imperfect reflections of those living in Chaydis, in the hopes of guiding the mortals toward the concept of questioning their reality, questioning what they 'know'.
They can appear in any reflective surface, though they can only properly reach through placid water.
One who's been replaced by a mirrorfolk is easily identified, if the person knows the looks of the original well enough; the slightest distortion in the surface of the water once the swap has taken place is reflected in the mirrorfolk, and so subtle strangeness in appearance is quite common.
The mirrorfolk themselves are not particularly violent or mean-spirited, they just wish to experience this strange world of 'reality' as much as they can until they have to go back.
The one who was dragged in would find themselves trapped in [[Mesaf]], unable to return until they are finally swapped back.
