# Sleepless Ravens

Hiding amongst packs of regular ravens, these three-eyed birds can infiltrate unsuspecting settlements to cause havoc.  
If restless nights plague you, and nightmares find you whenever you encounter blessed moments of slumber, best to check your roof for signs of a nest.  
Telltale signs are that your nightmare will show a three eyed raven right before everything goes wrong, or, more easily remembered, everyone in the home will be experiencing the same inability to rest.  
Sleepless Ravens are crafty, and swift.  
Certainly you could try to kill it.  
Many a brave soul has fallen off of their own roof in exhausted, delirious haze.  
The far safer method is to drive the flock away, though it's quite a bit more involved.  
By figuring out which dark thought in your home lured them there in the first place, and resolving the issue, the ravens will be compelled to leave and take up residence elsewhere.
