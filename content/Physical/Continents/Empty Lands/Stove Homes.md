# Stove Homes

## Overview

The standard home design of the [[Empty Lands]].  
In order to take advantage of the insulating properties of snow, the foundation of the building is dug down into the ice and snow.  
The exact shape depends on the flotsam, jetsam, and driftwood available along the local coast's ship graveyard.  
A circular base and walls to match seems to be the most widely favored, so that snow can't catch on corners as easily.  
The roof is usually fairly low to the ground and rounded as well, preventing any portion of it from being caught up in the wind.  
A chimney is a must for the outside, usually hooded by a similar structure shape to the rest of the roof.  
The doorway of the home is built out from the rest of the structure, with another door separating that from the main room, allowing for an antechamber of sorts between the inside and the outside.  
The main room is built around a stove.  
The front half of the room is at a lower elevation, with the back having a raised platform that surrounds the stove and helps to keep the blankets draped over it warm.  
The raised half is the sleeping area, while the lower is for cooking, cleaning, and any other activities.
