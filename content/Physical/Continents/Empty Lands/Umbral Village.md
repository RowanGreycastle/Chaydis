# Umbral Village

## Overview

A small village at the edge of the [[Empty Lands]], with no exports to speak of.
Decorations cover the windbreaking walls, and beyond them, short, dome-shaped [[Stove Homes|stove homes]] can be seen with lights flickering through [[Cobbleglass|cobbleglass]] windows.
At the center of it all, a taller building stands, starting similarly to the others, but with an oddly reinforced tower built on top.
Spindly outcroppings housing flickering lamplight and odd streamers cast strange shadows that stretch out across the ice and snow.
During the day, [[Varin|varin]] can be seen coming and going, doing their daily activities.
At night, the only sign that any live here is the smoke coming from their round-capped chimneys.
