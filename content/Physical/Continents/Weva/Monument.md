# Monument

## Overview

In the age of [[Humans|humans]], this city's walls were built.
Its streets bustled with life, and trade caravans would cross the wide plains to do business within the fortifications.
Now, among the isles of [[Weva]], this city's walls continue to stand, untouched, undaunted.
No sounds can be heard from inside, save the whipping of wind and the shifting of ice and snow.

This city stands as a monument to what is at stake when meddling in realms one does not fully understand.
It is known as such by the [[Lagos|lagos]] population nearby, as that is the only explanation they can come up with as to why this one patch of land, on this one island, is trapped in a perpetual state of Winter.
What else could it be?

## Secrets

Monument was one of the first attempts to use the power of the crystallized [[Mana|mana]] in a defensive fashion.
The intent was to create a permanent enchanted dome of ice to protect from aerial attacks, though this was a bit too ambitious.
