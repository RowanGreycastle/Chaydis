# Sunroads
### The Safest Paths

Indestructible roads built into each claimed, non-frozen continent of Chaydis.
It is claimed that these were created by [[Famott]] as a way to denote His suggested 'best location' for a central hub.
Along these roads, the [[Sunlight Soldiers]] patrol, making them easily one of the safest ways to travel during the day.
