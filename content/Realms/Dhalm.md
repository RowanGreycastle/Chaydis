# Dhalm
### The Travelling Public House

## Overview

[[Narys]] struggled to meet the requirement of a mobile facility that allowed her to offer care and shelter to the ill and unfortunate of the world.
She could not be everywhere at once, could not save even a fraction of those who were lost.
And it was through that frustration at her own helplessness that she was inspired twofold.

Additional help was a must, certainly, and so she made the [[Essence Seekers]].
The far more wonderous feat was the creation of Dhalm.
Certainly, every god has a realm that they call their own, but the methods for entry are generally relatively static.
[[Narys]] managed to attach the entrances to small carts, allowing for the facilities stored within to be easily 'transported' to wherever they needed to be.

Within the carts, a whole courtyard of space can be found, with a nicely furnished soup kitchen, some warm beds, and the opportunity to start a new life in a completely different land.
Nothing forces those who come here to return to the place they came from.

Strangely, none who come here opt to stay, despite the comfortable conditions.
It's as though something compels them to leave once they've had a chance to get back on their feet.
