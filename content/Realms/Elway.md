# Elway
### The Realm of Dreams

## Overview

The process of sleeping was foreign to [[Gese]].
Curiosity got him to learn from the [[Humans|humans]] what was involved.
"A great darkness, a sea of nothing, terrifying and empty." is what they described.
The whimsical god saw this as something that should be resolved, and so he created the dream realm, Elway.

Within the realm, thoughts took shape, actions only had consequences so long as one remembered that they should, and overall it was created as a sort of mental playground.
And within this realm, [[Gese]]'s own thoughts solidified.
His want to create something similar to [[Humans|humans]] took an ever-shifting shape, the protype of the [[Acita|acita]].
They were capable of moving through this ever-shifting place, a permanent fixture in a swirl of colour and shapes, native to this realm.

There are few outside of the [[Acita|acita]] who can properly move about and interact in a way that persists.
All else are but visitors, subject to the flow of things.
Their consciousness is transported in part to this strange realm.
And sleep is far more interesting an experience because of it.
