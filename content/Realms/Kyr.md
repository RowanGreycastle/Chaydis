# Kyr
### The Grand Hall of Victories

[[Arken]] believes that those who perform great and terrible deeds should be remembered for all time, whether history remembers them or not.
In pursuit of this ideal, she tried many things to ensure that she upheld her end of the bargain, though this was discovered to be quite difficult indeed.

Keeping all of it straight proved to be quite the difficult task for her, and [[Metti]] held no interest in helping her keep track of the specific beings she took a liking to.
If not for an offhand suggestion of keeping a diary, Kyr might never have been made in the first place!

Taking the idea given to her by her older sister, and combining it with the [[Humans|human]] concept of a trophy room, [[Arken]] created this realm.
A single vast book, surrounded by works of art, signed documents, suits of armor, famous weapons, and all manner of other things!

One may ask, what good is it to be documented in this hall of victories?
What use is it to store your great works away in this mythical pocket of reality?
It ensures many things.
Your works will endure the test of time, unless they encounter something more storied than themselves.
Your name will never be forgotten, not by the gods, nor by the world, lingering on in stories.
Finally, your work does not LEAVE Chaydis.
It is still, in whole, where it will be when you leave it.
Its presence within Kyr is merely a link; an attachment frozen in time, ensuring that it can not be damaged by simple wear and tear.
