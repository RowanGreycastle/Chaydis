### The Realm of Reflection

## Overview

[[Seith]] wished to ensure that the creatures of the realm did not become too complacent with their thoughts.
He knew well that the tales of the goings on within the ocean itself wouldn't spread far inland, and even if it did, it would be waved away as the ravings of a lunatic.
Things that make one question the world were best experienced as directly as possible, for full effect.

And so he set to work, crafting an imitation of Chaydis, down to the last, smallest detail.
One that could squish and stretch as needed, to be viewed through any sufficiently shiny surface.
Mind, [[Seith]] is no builder of worlds, no crafter of lands, and so everything viewed in a reflection looks correct at first glance... but may have some unsettling feature that's hard to place.
A dense fog may prevent one from seeing long distances in the reflection, despite it being a bright, sunshine-filled day.
Grass may be entirely the wrong shade of green.
The night sky may possess eyes instead of stars...

Not ALL reflections lead to Masef; in fact, the majority are fine!
But occasionally, one's reflection may wave back at them.
The [[Mirrorfolk|mirrorfolk]] seem pleasant enough when viewed through glass...
Though if one should get too close while admiring them through placid water...
Well, let's just say that there are tales of such things.
