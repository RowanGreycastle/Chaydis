### The Maze Beyond the Sky

A grand creation of [[Metti]].

## General

This realm contains within it all rules for [[Mana|mana]], and its uses, displayed for all to see, written in the stars.
The constellations themselves are present here, arranged as a vast labyrinth in the sky.

## Speculation

The shifting of the stars reflects alterations to the rules of [[Mana|mana]], according to some.
To others, it's less of a reflection, and more that this place is where the rules themselves are written and altered.

## Secrets

This is also the location that [[Dungeons|dungeons]] come from, as each dungeon is a part of the great connection that dictates the flow of [[Mana|mana]] through the world.
The [[Dungeons|dungeons]] themselves are made by [[Metti]] to allow for a deeper understanding of the workings of [[Mana|mana]].
Additionally, they are the only way to repair the rules of [[Mana|mana]] when something breaks them.
