# Tenub
### The Realm of Shadows

## Overview

Long ago, [[Shax]] was alone.
He does not remember when he came to be, and he does not remember when the [[Empty Lands]] or Tenub were made.
He knows that he made them, and he knows that from his own perspective, they have always been.
He exists, eternally, in both places at once, thus his appearance.

Tenub is a place always just out of reach, but fully visible.
Shadows stretching out along the ground, ARE the ground within this realm.
Within, there is only white, and black; an unimpeded fall, or a place to stand, respectively.
Doors, walls, and all manner of other defenses might well not even exist to one travelling through this place, if the place beyond is lit just so.
If there is no light beyond, it's nigh impossible to judge where to aim for, and no guarantee that something horrible won't happen.
And if there are shadows cast upon the walls, it's impenetrable, utterly and completely.
No amount of force can dissipate a shadow, after all.

Very few living things find themselves in this strange place, and so those who do encounter a strange, unnerving calm of the white and black void.
And if they should come at night, or stay late enough to experience it, they might be surprised to find that simple darkness does not suffice to make a platform.
A shadow is a distinct thing, with distinct rules, and darkness is darkness, simple as that.
Or at least, that's how the [[Varin|varin]] would explain it.
