### The Realm of Shadows

A grand creation of [[Shax]].

## General

A flat world overlayed atop Chaydis, showing only the stark white of light, and the shadows cast by all things.
All with eyes can 'see' this alternate world, but only the [[Varin|varin]] and the [[Shadow Lanterns]] can truly go there; only they can experience the strange calm and safety of the infinite white and black void.
Much like the children of other species, balancing on precarious shadows is key to move around in this place; though to trip and fall means you pop out into the world proper, and potentially at the wrong moment.
