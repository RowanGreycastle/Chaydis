# Essence Seekers

## Appearance

These creatures possess an unnatural beauty and poise.
It's quite rare that one would be able to see them in this fashion though.
Far more commonly, they disguise themselves among the less fortunate of society, seeking out those who help another without seeking compensation.

## Overview

They shroud themselves perfectly, and even close inspection will not reveal them.
Originally, true acts of hospitality were rewarded with a gift one week after the event, so as not to incentivize the wrong behavior.
This practice is still in effect, however, there are still some who tried to deceive the servants of [[Narys]].
Punishments have been enacted.
