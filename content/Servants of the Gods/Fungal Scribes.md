# Fungal Scribes

## Appearance

Mushroomfolk that gather, transmit, and record the thoughts of the dead.

## Overview

These servants of [[Verath]] work diligently to document the deceased.
The information of all dead things, biological and conceptual, eventually ends up being gathered to the [[Library of All Ends|Grand Library]], said to be tucked somewhere deep beneath the foliage and underbrush of [[Laef]]; though it may not exist anywhere so physical as that.
The blind caretakers of the library painstakingly copy down all information given to them, before it's collected, organized, and sorted.
There has been the occasional sighting of these creatures away from the library, though always in the most illogical of locations.

## Secrets

Due to the nature of [[Pang]] appearing and disappearing as the twilight hour approaches and passes, there are times that one of the fungal scribes will find themselves stuck within the mortal realm.
This is very rarely intentional.
