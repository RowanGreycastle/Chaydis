# Lurking Informants

## Appearance

Felines made purely of water; whatever's available in the area.

## Overview

People joke about cats being 'more fluid than animal'.
For [[Seith]]'s minions, that's more accurate than one might imagine.
His smiling felines tuck themselves away in interesting spots, gathering secrets and rumors.
If one is encountered, there's a good chance they're looking to trade information for strange favors down the line.

Example Favors "Go to the tavern three days from now, order a dry ale and a porkchop sandwich, then be sure to loudly compliment the ale."
"The next time you wake up before [[The Sun|the sun]], go outside, find a brick, spin around three times with your eyes closed, then throw it as hard as you can."
"Give me the rest of that steak."

Rumors and secrets are best kept to oneself on rainy days.

## Secrets

Like many of the servants of the gods, these cats were a first attempt at a solo creation of a species.
Instead of utterly scrapping the attempt, they were repurposed into an information network far subtler than that of [[Famott]].
