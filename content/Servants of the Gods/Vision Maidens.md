# Vision Maidens

## Appearance

Originally, they were simple spiders, granted the power of foresight.
Now, they are spider-like maidens who conceal their many eyes.

## Overview

These women tuck themselves away in places not frequented, and leave clues as to where they might be.
Only those with the ability to notice are granted the opportunity to receive a maiden's insight into the days to come.
They act as a hint, never providing the whole answer, so as not to spoil the discovery.
They are servants of [[Metti]], who advances them as she gains knowledge.
