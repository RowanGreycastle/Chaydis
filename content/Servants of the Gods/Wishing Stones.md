# Wishing Stones

## Appearance

They appear as any other stone.

## Overview

Hidden among the rocks one might find at a beach, very rarely, one of [[Gese]]'s wish granting stones might just be discovered.
There is no indication that this is a wish granting stone. Once the wish is made, out loud while holding the stone... if it is an interesting wish, [[Gese]] may hear of it, and grant it!
Mind... it doesn't have to be a stone.
Why limit oneself?
[[Gese]]'s minions must follow a few strict sets of rules.
The rules are specific, but simple, allowing for plenty of corner cases, workarounds, and creative interpretations.
They are servants of [[Gese]], rocks that he found in his search for his favourite rock, whom he granted a task to.

## Secrets

The Wishing Stones are the various different rocks that [[Gese]] has discovered while looking for his favourite rock.
Not wanting to waste such rocks, he instead gave them a purpose.
