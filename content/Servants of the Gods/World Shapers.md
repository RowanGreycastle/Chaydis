# World Shapers

## Appearance

Vast metal snakes that work beneath the land.
Very rarely are they seen, as they would normally only travel aboveground during a disaster.

## Overview

They work slowly to reshape the landmasses into more stable forms.
Their passage beneath can sometimes be felt quite clearly by those above.
The tunnels they create stretch and loop around beneath the surface.
They are the servants of [[Crom]], who values them immensely.

## Secrets

They build layers atop the [[Possibility]] to keep it buried.
The Shapers function as guardians, keeping the seal below from being breached from either end.
