# Lux
### The Lunar City

## General

Located entirely on the underside of [[The Moon|the mountainous moon]], a sparkling, glowing city exists.
The [[Acita|acita]] (aptly) dreamt up and brought this vibrant creation to reality, lighting up the night sky in the process.
To those who live there, it's a glorious reminder that the world of dreams can be brought to reality with enough work and patience.

Zip lines run between the various different buildings, allowing for quick travel.
Other methods of travel are certainly more efficient, but decidedly less popular among the populace.

Lux is one of two [[Acita|acita]] cities, though the other lies in [[Elway]].
These two cities are the only cities currently known to exist in Chaydis.
