The massive mountain traveling overhead does an excellent job of dragging the wind along with it, resulting in not just high tide beneath it, but choppy waters as well. The lower [[The Moon|the moon]], the stronger the waves... Though with a low flying moon, the size of the waves may be the lesser problem.
