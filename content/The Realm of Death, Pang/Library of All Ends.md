# The Library of All Ends
### Pang's Records

Located within [[Pang]].

[[Verath]]'s [[Fungal Scribes|servants]] work tirelessly within the halls of this massive library, built into an old gnarled tree.
This place is said to be a thorough documentation of everything that has ever lived and died, ranging from the greatest of generals, to the lowliest of insects, the most obscure of plants, and even the lifespan of concepts!
Any theory ever disproven has been written about within the books here.
It is only through the assistance of one of the [[Fungal Scribes|servants]] that one would be capable of finding what they're looking for, if they should somehow wind up in this place.
The easiest way to reach her would most likely be by nature of being a [[Kalis|kalis]] and dying.
To live within this [[Library of All Ends|library]] and the surrounding lands is said to be the [[Kalis|kalis]] afterlife.
