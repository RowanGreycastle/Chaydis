# Crom
### God of Duty

## Appearance

Crom requests to be represented within works depicting the gods not as himself, but as his [[World Shapers]], as they are hard workers who deserve recognition.
Outside of such works, he takes the form of a humanoid elephant.
His left tusk is broken, and his eyes are sightless, but he exudes an air of determination that makes it clear he does not consider himself incapable.

## Overview

As [[Famott]]'s [[The Sunspire|great spear]] struck true, and pinned the writhing mass of [[Possibility]], he called out for help.
Crom answered that call.
With a determination that none can match, he created metal and stone to encase it within.
And upon that metal and stone, he put further stone, and again, and again, until there was no sign of it.
It is upon this stone and metal and dirt that the people of Chaydis now live.
And despite his work, he would not be able to admire this new landscape.
As he'd toiled, the creature had touched him, had stolen away his eyesight.
If not for the diligence of Crom, this place called home by many would not be.
Though, despite his instrumental position in the creation of all, and his great sacrifice for it, he is humble, focusing instead on what he can do to maintain it.
Since that day, he has kept close watch on the trapped beast that continues to wriggle its way toward the surface, and he has not been idle.
His duty toward the call he answered still holds strong.
His focus does not waver from his task.
He will continue until there is nothing more to hold back.

## Grand Creations

Crom created all of the land of Chaydis.
Every mountain and valley, every plain and desert.
Though He would not consider them grand creations, merely byproducts of his work.

Crom's valued [[World Shapers]] were created not to give himself more free time, but to keep more eyes available in the event that an escape attempt should happen in a place he can not feel.
They actively build the stone and metal beneath the feet of those that live on the surface.

[[Arken]] approached him with the proposition of creation, though he only agreed once he had a proper grasp of why he would want to do something like that.
Were it not for her persistence in making him understand, the [[Gurem|gurem]] would never have been.

[[Verath]] - A firm friend, in whom he can confide.

[[Shax]] - A lonely creature that deserves pity.

[[Seith]] - An inscrutable thing that hides away, no doubt plotting something in unseen places.
