# Famott
### God of Order

## Appearance

Famott appears within works depicting the gods as himself, as he truly is; a tall and imposing humanoid moth, with a fiery disposition and a missing left eye.
If he is seen at all, it should be in that form.
He is quite particular about his look, as well as depictions of himself.

## Overview

Chaydis would not be without him.
His absolute judgement to capture [[Possibility]], to pin it to a reality, to shape land around it.
This was Famott's great plan; a plan to create a world, perfect, hand-sculpted, with every detail accounted for.
Tireless work went into organizing the [[The Six and Three|Six]], in the hopes that they would share in his vision.
[[Verath]] and [[Crom]] had similar beliefs about Chaydis, about his systems and rules and order.
[[Gese]] was the first to openly question why such things were needed, and would not accept that it was simply the best way to do things.
[[Shax]] expressed his displeasure with such rigidity, and [[Seith]] said nothing at all, simply withdrawing himself beneath the waves.
No matter; balance in such things was its own form of order.
Three to maintain, and three to disrupt.
Famott frequently finds himself in situations that appear to have fallen into chaos...
But even in chaos, order can be found.

## Grand Creations

Famott is the one who created [[The Sunspire|the Sunspire]], who plunged it through [[Possibility]] and pinned it to the reality created by [[Shax]].
Were it not for this, Chaydis would not be.

Within Chaydis, he has done a great many works.
Through his interactions with [[Shax]], the seasons were created.
Through his creation of [[The Sun|the sun]], [[Gese]] in turn created [[The Moon|the moon]].
He has offered mortals insight into His realm of planning, allowing them to gaze upon his rules within their own mind.
Through patterns, connections, and irrefutable truths, he guides those lucky few mortals closer to his vision.

His servants, his [[Sunlight Soldiers]] patrol another of his creations, his [[Sunroads]], during the daylight hours, ensuring that they are the safest path to travel.

His realm... **PLACEHOLDER

And finally, his own direct mortal creations, his [[Inuri|inuri]]. He had provided the initial design to [[Narys]], who took what he had made and adjusted them in ways she saw fit.
Without her, his antfolk would be mere automatons, unable to express themselves, and unable to interact properly with the creations of others.
Such a thing would not do.
