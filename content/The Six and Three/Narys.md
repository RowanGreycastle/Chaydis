# Narys
### Goddess of Community

## Appearance

Narys appears within works depicting the gods as a large table laden with food, located in a field of grain.
A symbol of togetherness and celebration for a god whose works bring the public together.
Outside of that, she takes a form that shifts between onlookers, appearing as a person they find familiar and comforting, even if that individual has no such person in their life.

## Overview

When the Age of Everything began, when Chaydis's people first came together, Narys came to be.
Upon first sight of a human, she discovered what she wanted to do.
With empathy and compassion, she spoke to the people, encouraging cooperation to avoid mass hardships.
She is the radiating beacon of community, the one who holds Chaydis together with the smallest actions of kindness.
To know her is to know one's neighbors, to understand that good relationships can save one from the darkest times.
Will you hole away in safety, hoarding resources to yourself and your family?
Or will you help to build a better, more stable future?

## Grand Creations

[[Dhalm]] is a creation of hers inspired by necessity.
It is through the actions taken within this place that many less fortunate individuals survive harsh times.
There was no grand metaphysical purpose behind its creation, other than the preservation of life.

She could not handle all of the different places that she was needed at once.
And while she had asked the people to ensure that there was care for the sick and the injured, she could not rely on them.
And so, she made her [[Essence Seekers]], to work within [[Dhalm]] and to hide among the downtrodden, so as to reward those who were truly generous and caring.
The original methods proved to be too lenient, and so punishments had to be implemented for those who tried to ruin things.

Her gentle words and guiding hand steered the [[Inuri|inuri]] from the path of being purely mechanical in their methodology.
[[Famott]] was so obsessed with making everything 'just so' that he would have either never completed them, or would have crafted something that he would not be satisfied with.

Her willingness to humor [[Gese]]'s good nature allowed her to make suggestions and give proper shape and form to the [[Acita|acita]].
Much like [[Famott]], he couldn't ever seem to decide when he was done.
Unlike [[Famott]], however, he was endlessly creative; to a fault in many ways.
With careful questions and thoughtful insight, she ensured that it all worked out in the end.

## Religious Practices

Those who devote themselves to Narys tend to be drawn in one of two directions.
Either they will become a caretaker in some fashion, working in an orphanage, a shelter, or some other similar task.
Or they will become a guardian in some way, defending the weak and the helpless from external threats, while upholding the ideals and laws within.

As with all things, there can certainly be overlap.
A shelter worker who knows how to pin a man taller than them can be quite useful.
And the same goes for a guard who is aware of how to calmly de-escalate a situation where violence is unnecessary.
