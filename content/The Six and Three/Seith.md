# Seith
### God of The Unknown

## Appearance

Seith appears within works depicting the gods as himself, as he truly is; a great and terrifying leviathan with many eyes and many tendrils.
If he is within his ocean, he is presumably in that form.
It is when he is NOT within that ocean that his form becomes uncertain.
Strange, human shaped 'men' have been encountered throughout Chaydis, claiming to be Seith when confronted.
Each one encountered has been wrapped head to toe in cloth, with no exposed skin.

## Overview

As the metal and stone piled higher and higher, some sections of the land began to crack; others melted.
The bindings offered by [[Verath]] sufficed to keep [[Crom]]'s construction from fracturing, but it was only through Seith's dousing of the lowest spaces that escape was prevented.
His work was swift, quenching the metals into something more than where they'd started, flooding the bowl that [[Famott]]'s mighty strike had dug out in an instant.
The [[Outring Ocean|Ring Ocean]] was created in that moment, sure to keep such attempts from functioning in the future, and securing his place as essential among the rest.
His movements were careful, practiced, as he interacted with the others of the [[The Six and Three|Six]], subtly influencing them in ways they might still not be aware of.
To 'know' him is to 'know' a placid lake.
The surface is calm, serene, peaceful, never hinting at what IS beneath, only telling some of what is NOT.

## Grand Creations

Seith's [[Lurking Informants]] act as his eyes and ears in places his influence can not normally reach.
So long as it rains in a place, he will eventually know the comings and goings of its people.

Seith's efforts and actions have resulted in more than just the [[Outring Ocean]], though it's arguable that the rest are the actions of [[Famott]].

[[Arken]] seemed to understand him better than the others, and spoke her mind to him without reservation.
He so admired this trait, that when they worked together to make the [[Lagos|lagos]], he ensured they would inherit it.

His realm, [[Mesaf]], is a poor copy of Chaydis, formed as if from memory, with certain details utterly wrong.
It is from this warped place that many of the creatures that hunt through mimicry are from.
For what purpose this place was made, only Seith truly knows.
