# Shax
### God of The Infinite

## Appearance

Shax appears within works depicting the gods as himself, as he truly is; the shadow of a humanoid weasel with glinting red eyes, cast upon whatever surface is available.
If he is seen at all, it should be in that form.
He is very rarely seen, due to his nature.

## Overview

Before Chaydis, before [[Possibility]], Shax ruled his [[Empty Lands]] and their [[Tenub|reflection]].
The sole existence upon an unending plain of motionless, featureless void.
It is unknown for how long he has existed, had been alone.
It is believed that long after Chaydis meets its end, Shax will continue.
He, weasel of shadow, cunning hunter, deceptive trickster, is eternal.
He is, however, already changed from what he was.
Experiences he never could have imagined have made sure of this.
Surprise, awe, intrigue, friendship, what it feels like to laugh, what a family is.
These are things he never knew, things that shaped him, things that continue to shape him.
Loss, sorrow, anger, hatred, what it means to be hated, what it means to be loathed.
These too are things that he has discovered, that have shaped him.
To be infinite does not mean to be unchanging, it is simply to be unending.
When Chaydis ends, he will not be alone.
His [[Varin|family]] will persist.
Until that day, until that very moment, he will work to ensure that no day is truly boring.

## Grand Creations

Shax is the one who created this pocket of reality within which [[Possibility]] now resides.
Were it not for this creation of his, Chaydis would not be.

He himself would consider the [[Varin|varin]] to be his grandest creation, as they are his children.
And without his project to create them, he doubtless never would have truly interacted with [[Metti]], whose thirst for knowledge sparked his own inquisitiveness.

His servants, his aids, the [[Shadow Lanterns]] who travel through the dark searching for materials for his children, are a close second in his opinion.
Without them, his family could not grow, and his children could be forever lost to him.

His realm, [[Tenub]], is the place upon which all shadows are made tangible.
It is speculated that before Chaydis, Shax would alternate where he sat, simply to see if there was any difference at all within the endless spaces.

Through his ceaseless pestering of [[Famott]], the seasons change and the weather shifts.
Nothing is left to be stagnant, despite the [[Wite]] that permeates the [[Empty Lands]].
