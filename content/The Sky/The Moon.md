# The Moon
### The Looming Mountain

The cosmic creation of [[Gese]], later gifted to his [[Acita|acita]].

The concentration of [[Mana|mana]] found here is nearly entirely [[Aer]].

## General

The tallest mountain of Chaydis, which originally surrounded [[The Sunspire]], was ripped from the ground long ago and set upon a course in the sky by the god of whimsy Himself.
The city of [[Lux]] was built by the [[Acita|acita]] after their creation, allowing the moon to glow naturally in the night sky.
Those who were around before the lunar city's creation argue that the moon was glowing before that.

Due to where it'd been before being ripped up out of the ground, there is a large hole that travels up the center of the moon, allowing one directly beneath it to look up and still see the night sky through it.
