# Outring Ocean
### Dangerous and Impractical to Traverse

An ocean that surrounds all but the [[Empty Lands]], separating it from the rest of Chaydis.
The waters are far more turbulent than any of the seas, and an unprepared vessel is likely to be smashed into kindling on the far shores.
Reaching the bottom of it is entirely out of the question to land-dwelling folks.
